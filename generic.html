								<p>I grew up in Michigan, on the west side of Grand Rapids where I moved school districts three times, once at every milestone. Elementary, middle, and highschool were all spent with entirely different groups of classmates, each time the transition came with new challenges. Now that I am graduating from my second university after under going yet another difficult transition, this time shared by the world in 2020, I am so thankful for the many lessons these experiences have taught me. Aside from teaching me adaptability and patience, I have grown a love for new experiences and taking on challenges! </p>
								<p>After taking an interest in environmental studies during high school, I set to taking as many major specific courses as possible while at Michigan State University, hoping to become part of the solution to the world's toughest challenges. I even started my minor that first semester, Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems, and was quickly inspired by the program director Julie Cotton, with her engaging coursework and industry experience, to study agriculture further. It became my major my Sophomore year through MSU's Organic Horticulture Program which offered a new set of hands-on classes and opportunites. This experience was cut short by the global pandemic as students were sent home by the thousands in the middle of the spring semester. I think all students will remember this time as part of their learner's journey, as well as many other things. The sudden changing of my circumstances pushed me to transfer to Northern Michigan University just before the start of the new semester. Though this change came with yet another set of challenges, my opportunities at Northern Michigan University have added a whole layer to my learning journey with a greater focus on data science. I'm not sure where this journey will lead me, but I know I can look forward to learning every day with each opportunity!</p>
